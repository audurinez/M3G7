    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
    <!--First comment
    I can see that the h1 element has a attribute that references the typescript element. 
    In the script element the first element is a way to give a name the element.
    I think it is just a title, only a text. -->

    <!-- Second comment
     This was not far off. The id attribute in the html element is a way to give the element a name. That way the script can select that html element.
     That way the content is set in the script element (the text) 
     -->
    <script>
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>
