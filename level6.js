//you can comment this file too by adding // before the comment

// Here a let variable has been added. That variable is now used to set the innterhtml of the h1 element. 
//This might be beneficial if the plan is to reuse the greeting text or if it should change dynamically
let greeting = "Hello, world!";
document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = greeting;

//from now on all the HTML files will look the same so there is no need to comment them
