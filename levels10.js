//This is the final boss. If you are able to understand fully what is going on here you are ready to take on the world of JavaScript!
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 10);
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The result is: " + result;

// Here a calculation formula has been creatidn using a add function. The add function will show the sum of a and b. In the curly brackets the forumla is written.
// The variable result  will show the the results of the calculations
// That way you can write more result variables. Here only one is written the 5 + 10 
//the innerhtml will then show the text " the result is 15"
// this is an example of how javascript can be used to change the content of an html dynamically.
